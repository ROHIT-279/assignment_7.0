    "# --> An API, short for Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It specifies how different software components should interact, defining the types of requests that can be made, the data formats that should be used, and the actions or responses that can be expected.\n",

    "# An example of an API used in real life is the Google Maps API. It provides a set of functions and procedures that allow developers to integrate Google Maps into their own applications or websites. Through this API, developers can access features such as displaying maps, adding markers, calculating directions, and retrieving location data. By utilizing the Google Maps API, developers can enhance their applications with mapping and location-based functionalities without having to build these features from scratch.\n"

    "# Scalability: APIs enable developers to build scalable applications by abstracting complex functionalities into easily consumable services. This allows applications to handle increased user loads and data volumes without significant performance degradation.\n",

Upgrading to a new API version or ensuring compatibility across different versions can be a complex task, especially for applications that rely on multiple APIs.\n"

    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "----> REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two architectural styles used for designing web services. They differ in their approach to communication, data formats, and protocol usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST Architecture:\n",
    "REST is an architectural style that uses the principles of the World Wide Web. It is based on a client-server model where the server exposes a set of resources, and clients can access and manipulate these resources using standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. RESTful APIs typically use lightweight data formats like JSON or XML for data exchange. Key features of REST include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      Stateless: REST is stateless, meaning each request from the client to the server contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request. The server does not maintain any client-specific state between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a uniform interface that follows a set of standardized conventions. This includes the use of HTTP methods, resource identification using URLs, and hypermedia links to navigate between resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable and Cacheable: RESTful APIs are designed to be scalable and support caching. Caching responses can improve performance and reduce server load by allowing clients to reuse previously retrieved responses.\n",
    "    \n",
    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
